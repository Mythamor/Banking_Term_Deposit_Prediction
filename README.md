# Moringa Data Science Group Project

##Business Understanding
A bank is experiencing a decline in revenue and seeking to boost it by increasing long term deposits. They intend to identify existing customers who are most likely to open long term deposits accounts. The bank collected data through telemarketing. The objective of the project is to develop a classification model that can predict whether a customer will open a long term deposit account or not. The analysis and model will help the bank in target market segmentation, thus increasing their conversion rate, and in extension, the revenue.

#Data Understanding
The dataset has 16 columns and 32950 rows with both categorical and numeric variables. The categorical variables include job, marital, education, default, housing, loan, contact, month, day_of_week, poutcome, and y(target variable). The numeric variables include age, duration, campaign, pdays, and previous(contact information)

#Data Preparation
Investigate and fix;
1.Duplicates
2.Missing Values
3.Outliers
4.Multicollinearity


# Data Modeling
Four Classification algorithms were used:
###1.DecisionTreeClassifier: 

###2.LogisticRegression: 

###3.RandomForestClassifier: 

###4.K- Nearest Neighbor: 


#Data Evaluation
The team focused on accuracy and presicion metrics to evaluate the models.
